Feature: Footer
  In order to delve deeper into the project
  As a potential contributer
  I want to have information about the project and the team

  The footer should be visible on every page

  Scenario: See related links and information
    When I visit the landing page
    Then I shoud see links to similar projects
    And I should see links to project's facebook page and group
    And I should see obstestvo's email and logo
